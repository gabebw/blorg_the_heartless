# Blorg the Heartless

Blorg the Heartless (a/k/a Honorifics) pulls tweets containing the phrase "the
{word}", classifies the word as a noun or an adjective, then prints out "Prince
Leopold the {word}" if it's an adjective (like Prince Leopold the Speedy) or
"Prince Leopold of the {word}" if it's a noun (like Prince Leopold of the Corn).

It uses the twitter and engtagger gems to pull from twitter and classify the
parts of speech.
